# Dashboard Screenshot

This is a placeholder for a screenshot of the Rock Fragment Detection Dashboard running with some example data. A screenshot will make the README more visually appealing and help users understand what the application looks like when running.

## Suggested Screenshot

Capture an image showing:
1. The main dashboard interface with a rock fragment image loaded
2. The Fragment Detection tab showing the combined visualization with colored masks
3. Metrics displayed at the top showing fragment counts and sizes

## How to Add

Replace the screenshot.png file in this directory with an actual screenshot once the application is running with sample data.
